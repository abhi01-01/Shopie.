> **Project Description**:

MERN stack is a popular choice for building web applications that require both the front-end and back-end to be developed using JavaScript. An e-commerce website is a great use case for a MERN stack application, as it requires seamless integration of different components such as a database, server, and client-side interface.

To build a robust e-commerce web application using the MERN stack, the following key features are essential.

1. Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT): User authentication is an important aspect of an e-commerce application, and JWTs provide a secure way of verifying user identity.

2. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for all items in the store: This feature enables the admin to add, edit, view, and delete all items available in the store.

3. Shopping cart functionality: Users should be able to add items to their cart, view the contents of their cart, and remove items from it.

In conclusion, a well-designed MERN stack e-commerce application should include essential features such as user authentication, CRUD functionality, and shopping cart functionality. By leveraging the power of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, one can build a scalable and efficient web application that meets the requirements of an e-commerce store.


> **Build with**:

1. MongoDB: A document-oriented NoSQL database that provides a flexible data model and scalability.

2. Express.js: A back-end web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building APIs.

3. React.js: A front-end JavaScript library that enables the creation of interactive user interfaces.

4. Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime that provides a scalable and efficient way to build web applications.
